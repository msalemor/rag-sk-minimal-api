Resignation Policy
Contoso

As a valued employee of our company, we want to inform you about our layoff and resignation policies in case you ever need to use them. We hope that you will stay with us for a long time, but we understand that sometimes circumstances change and you may have to leave the company.

If you are laid off due to economic reasons or restructuring, you will receive a severance package based on your years of service and position. You will also be eligible for unemployment benefits and outplacement assistance. We will try to give you as much notice as possible before your last day of work, and we will provide you with a letter of recommendation if you request one.

If you decide to resign from your position, we ask that you give us at least two weeks' notice in writing. This will allow us to plan for your departure and find a suitable replacement. You will receive your final paycheck on your last day of work, and any unused vacation or sick days will be paid out according to the company policy. You will also be able to keep your health insurance coverage for up to 18 months under COBRA. We will conduct an exit interview with you to gather your feedback and suggestions for improvement.

We appreciate your hard work and dedication to our company, and we hope that you will have a smooth transition if you ever need to leave. Please contact the human resources department if you have any questions or concerns about our layoff and resignation policies.
