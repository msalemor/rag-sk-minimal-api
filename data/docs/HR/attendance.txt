Attendance Policy
Contoso

Attendance is an essential aspect of our company policy. It reflects the commitment and professionalism of our employees and contributes to the success of our projects and goals. We expect all employees to adhere to the following attendance policy:

- Employees should arrive at work on time and be ready to perform their duties at the start of their shift.
- Employees should notify their supervisor as soon as possible if they are unable to attend work or will be late for any reason.
- Employees should provide a valid reason and documentation for any absence or tardiness, such as a doctor's note, a court summons, or a family emergency.
- Employees should request and obtain approval for any planned leave, such as vacation, personal, or sick leave, in advance and in accordance with the company's leave policy.
- Employees should avoid excessive or habitual absenteeism or tardiness, which may affect their performance, productivity, and team morale.
- Employees who violate the attendance policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

We value our employees and appreciate their dedication and contribution to our company. We also understand that there may be circumstances that prevent employees from attending work or arriving on time. However, we expect all employees to respect the attendance policy and communicate with their supervisor in a timely and professional manner. By doing so, we can ensure a positive and productive work environment for everyone.
